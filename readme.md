# stscfg

This preliminary project captures some ideas to extend the basic mechanism from 
[static-config](https://github.com/Krever/static-config)
to incorporate features from [tscfg](https://github.com/carueda/tscfg).
Possible future directions to explore include combining or bringing in aspects from
[refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined), 
[bond](https://github.com/fwbrasil/bond) and similar.
